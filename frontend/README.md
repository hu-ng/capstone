# Frontend code for Jobful.

## Setting up
Thanks to `npm`, getting the front-end up and running requires only two steps:
- `npm install` in the local directory to get all the necessary packages.
    - Due to a [dependency problem](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/getting-started/installation), make sure you're getting v1.x version of @date-io adapters.
    - `npm i @date-io/date-fns@1.x date-fns` use this if it's not.
- `npm start` to run the project.
